The pentary client is written in TypeScript, NodeJS.
For the database we are using a NoSQL Database called MongoDB with the Mongoose NodeJS wrapper. 
Docker is available and ready to use, scroll down to learn more ...

-> For hosting we highly recommend a Linux machine (Ubuntu, Debian, ...)

Once a new change is pushed to the repo, github will automatically try to build the new changes with the TypeScript compiler. 
If everything passes, a ‚úÖ is displayed, if there are any errors, it will display ‚ùå.
